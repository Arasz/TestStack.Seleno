What is the MvcMusicStore sample about?

We wanted to provide you with a usage sample for Seleno and we knew that a lot of developers are familiar with MvcMusicStore.
So we imported the MvcMusicStore codebase (and after making some changes to it) made it as one of our samples.

The MvcMusicStore.FunctionalTests has a file called BrittleTests.cs which shows a typical example of a brittle UI test as generated
by screen recorders. We then fix the issues of that test in three steps (with code in Step1 to Step3 folders).

In Step4 we transform the test in Step3 to generate living documentation out of our UI tests and get even more value out of them.
